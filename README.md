# Asian-Hate-Analysis

## In this project, I harnessed the power of various libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Plotly, to conduct in-depth data cleaning and analysis. Focusing on the troubling rise in Asian hate crimes during 2020-2021, I embarked on a comprehensive data analysis journey. Beginning with formulating the research topic and generating pertinent research questions, I meticulously sourced data from platforms like Kaggle and performed web scraping on Twitter to gather a diverse range of information.

## Through this extensive process, I aimed to uncover the underlying factors contributing to the surge in Asian hate. By leveraging my data analysis skills, I explored patterns and correlations within the datasets, revealing potential connections between the rise in hate crimes and socio-economic factors such as high unemployment rates. Additionally, my analysis delved into specific comments from political figures targeting the Asian community, shedding light on the role of influential voices in shaping public perception.

## This project not only involved technical expertise in data analysis but also required a nuanced understanding of societal dynamics and political discourse. By synthesizing my research findings, I aimed to contribute valuable insights to the ongoing discourse surrounding hate crimes, advocating for awareness and understanding of the complex issues at hand.
